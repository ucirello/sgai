# GOAL.md Composer Reference

Complete reference documentation for composing GOAL.md files for SGAI.

---

## GOAL.md Format Specification

### Structure

A GOAL.md file consists of two parts:

```markdown
---
<YAML frontmatter>
---

<Markdown body: project description, requirements, tasks>
```

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `flow` | string (DOT format) | **Yes** | Directed acyclic graph defining agent execution order and dependencies |
| `models` | map[string]string | No | Per-agent model assignments with optional variant syntax |
| `completionGateScript` | string | No | Shell command that must succeed for workflow to be considered complete |
| `interactive` | string | No | Human interaction mode: `yes`, `no`, or `auto` |

---

## Frontmatter Field Details

### `flow` (Required)

DOT-format DAG defining which agents run and their dependencies.

**Syntax:**
- Edges: `"agent-a" -> "agent-b"` (agent-a must complete before agent-b starts)
- Standalone: `"agent-name"` (agent with no dependencies)
- Use double quotes around agent names
- Use `|` for multi-line YAML strings

**Example:**
```yaml
flow: |
  "go-developer" -> "go-reviewer"
  "go-developer" -> "stpa-analyst"
  "go-reviewer" -> "stpa-analyst"
  "general-purpose" -> "stpa-analyst"
  "htmx-picocss-frontend-developer" -> "htmx-picocss-frontend-reviewer"
  "htmx-picocss-frontend-reviewer" -> "stpa-analyst"
```

**Standalone agents (no dependencies):**
```yaml
flow: |
  "general-purpose"
  "htmx-picocss-frontend-developer" -> "htmx-picocss-frontend-reviewer"
```

**Rules:**
- The graph must be a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) - no cycles allowed
- The `coordinator` agent is ALWAYS present automatically - do NOT include it in the flow
- All agents listed in the flow will be available for task delegation

---

### `models` (Optional)

Per-agent model assignments. Supports variant syntax in parentheses.

**Example:**
```yaml
models:
  "coordinator": "anthropic/claude-opus-4-6 (max)"
  "go-developer": "anthropic/claude-opus-4-6"
  "go-reviewer": "anthropic/claude-opus-4-6"
  "general-purpose": "anthropic/claude-opus-4-6"
  "htmx-picocss-frontend-developer": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5"
```

**Notes:**
- Agents without explicit model assignments use `defaultModel` from `sgai.json` or system default
- Variant syntax (e.g., `(max)`) is passed through to the inference engine
- The `coordinator` should typically use the most capable model

---

### `completionGateScript` (Optional)

Shell command that determines if the workflow is complete. The workflow is only considered complete when this script exits with status 0.

**Examples:**
```yaml
completionGateScript: make test
```

```yaml
completionGateScript: go test ./... && npm run lint
```

```yaml
completionGateScript: ./scripts/verify-all.sh
```

---

### `interactive` (Optional)

Controls how agent questions are handled.

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `yes` | Agent questions appear in web UI; human responds interactively (recommended) |
| `no` | Workflow exits when an agent asks a question |
| `auto` | Self-driving mode; agents attempt to proceed without human input |

**Example:**
```yaml
interactive: yes
```

---

## Markdown Body

The body contains the project specification in markdown.

**Structure:**
```markdown
# Project Goal

Describe what you want to build here. Be specific about behavior,
not implementation. Focus on outcomes.

## Requirements

- What should happen when a user does X?
- What constraints exist?
- What does success look like?

## Tasks

- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
  - [ ] Task 2.1
- [ ] Task 3
```

**Key Points:**
- Checkboxes (`- [ ]`) are managed by the coordinator agent
- Nested checkboxes are supported for subtasks
- Focus on *what* to build, not *how*
- Be specific about behavior and constraints

---

## Available Agents

### Development Agents

| Agent | Description | Paired Reviewer |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| `go-developer` | Expert Go backend developer for APIs, CLI tools, and services with idiomatic Go patterns. Works with go-reviewer for code quality. | `go-reviewer` |

|-------|-------------|
| `go-reviewer` | Reviews Go code for readability, idioms, and best practices. Read-only - sends fixes via messaging. |
| `htmx-picocss-frontend-reviewer` | UI polish, accessibility, visual consistency for HTMX/PicoCSS interfaces. Read-only. |
| `react-reviewer` | React code review for best practices, performance, accessibility, hooks usage, and anti-patterns. Read-only. |
| `shell-script-reviewer` | Shell script correctness, portability, security review. Read-only. |
| `project-critic-council` | Multi-model council that validates completion claims with strict standards. |

---

## Mandatory Reviewer Pairing

> **CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:** Every coding agent **must** be paired with its corresponding reviewer agent.

| Development Agent | Required Reviewer |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| `go-developer` | `go-reviewer` |
| `htmx-picocss-frontend-developer` | `htmx-picocss-frontend-reviewer` |
| `react-developer` | `react-reviewer` |
| `shell-script-coder` | `shell-script-reviewer` |

### Enforcement Rules

When selecting a development agent:
1. **Auto-add** the paired reviewer to the agent selection
2. **Auto-create** the dependency edge in the flow DAG
3. **Show notice** explaining why the reviewer was added
4. **Warn** if user tries to remove reviewer while developer is selected

### Flow Pattern

```yaml
flow: |
  "go-developer" -> "go-reviewer"
```

### Exception: `general-purpose`

The `general-purpose` agent does not have a dedicated reviewer since it handles cross-domain tasks. It may optionally flow into `stpa-analyst` for safety analysis.

- [ ] **Flow DAG is valid** - No cycles, all edges point forward
- [ ] **Coordinator not in flow** - It's always present automatically
- [ ] **Reviewer pairing enforced** - Every developer agent has its reviewer
- [ ] **Reviewer edges exist** - Developer flows into reviewer (e.g., `"go-developer" -> "go-reviewer"`)
- [ ] **Models assigned correctly** - All agents in flow have model assignments (or use defaults)
- [ ] **Interactive mode set** - Explicitly set to `yes`, `no`, or `auto`
- [ ] **Specification complete** - Has Goal description, Requirements, and Tasks
- [ ] **Tasks use checkboxes** - Format: `- [ ] Task description`
- [ ] **No implementation details** - Focus on WHAT, not HOW
- [ ] **CompletionGateScript valid** - If set, command should be runnable

## Troubleshooting

### "Agent not found" Error
- Verify agent name is spelled correctly (case-sensitive)
- Check that agent is listed in the Available Agents section
- Ensure agent name is in double quotes in the flow

### "Cycle detected" Error
- Review the flow for circular dependencies
- Ensure reviewers don't flow back to developers
- Use a topological sort tool to verify DAG validity

### "Model not available" Error
- Check model name spelling
- Verify model is available in your opencode configuration
- Try using a different model variant

### Tasks not being tracked
- Ensure tasks use checkbox format: `- [ ]`
- Nested tasks should be indented with 2 spaces
- Don't use other list formats (*, 1., etc.) for trackable tasks
