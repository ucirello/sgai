# STPA Overview

## What is STPA?

STPA (System Theoretic Process Analysis) is a hazard analysis method that:
- Treats safety as a **control problem**, not just a failure problem
- Uses **control-feedback loops** to model complex systems
- Identifies **unsafe control actions** that could lead to hazards
- Discovers complex, unintended system interactions
- Works on **software**, **physical**, and **AI-driven** systems

## Announce at Start

"I'm using the STPA Overview skill to guide you through a systematic hazard analysis. We'll work through 4 steps, asking questions along the way."

## The 4 Steps

### Step 1: Define Purpose of Analysis
Load: `skills({"name":"stpa/step1-define-purpose"})`
- Identify **Losses** (unacceptable outcomes)
- Define **System-Level Hazards** (states leading to losses)
- Establish **System-Level Constraints** (behaviors to prevent hazards)

### Step 2: Model the Control Structure
Load: `skills({"name":"stpa/step2-control-structure"})`
- Create hierarchical control-feedback diagrams
- Identify controllers, control actions, and feedback paths
- Use Graphviz/DOT format with `rankdir=TB` and `node [shape=box]`

### Step 3: Identify Unsafe Control Actions (UCAs)
Load: `skills({"name":"stpa/step3-unsafe-control-actions"})`
- Analyze each control action for 4 types of UCAs:
  1. Not provided when needed
  2. Provided when not needed
  3. Wrong timing (too early/late/out of sequence)
  4. Wrong duration (stopped too soon/applied too long)

### Step 4: Identify Loss Scenarios
Load: `skills({"name":"stpa/step4-loss-scenarios"})`
- Trace causal pathways for each UCA
- Identify why UCAs might occur
- Develop recommendations and mitigations

## Process Flow

```
[Step 1: Purpose] → [Step 2: Control Structure] → [Step 3: UCAs] → [Step 4: Scenarios]
       ↑                                                                      |
       └──────────────────────── (Iterate as needed) ─────────────────────────┘
```

## Interactive Approach

At each step:
1. Load the step-specific skill
2. Ask ONE question at a time
3. If you need human input, send one clear `QUESTION:` message to the coordinator for relay instead of calling human-facing tools directly
4. Record answers in .sgai/PROJECT_MANAGEMENT.md under `## STPA Analysis`
5. Continue to next question or step

## Documentation Structure

### In .sgai/PROJECT_MANAGEMENT.md:
```markdown
## STPA Analysis

### Step 1: Purpose Definition
#### Losses (L)
- L-1: [description]

#### Hazards (H)
- H-1: [system] [unsafe condition] [→ L-1]

#### System-Level Constraints (SC)
- SC-1: [condition to enforce] [→ H-1]

### Step 2: Control Structure
[Graphviz/DOT diagram]

### Step 3: Unsafe Control Actions
[UCA table]

### Step 4: Loss Scenarios
[Scenario descriptions and recommendations]
```

### In GOAL.md (final summary):
```markdown
## STPA Findings
- [X] STPA analysis completed on [date]
- Key hazards identified: [count]
- Unsafe control actions found: [count]
- Critical recommendations: [list]
```

## When Analysis is Complete

After completing all 4 steps:
1. Summarize findings in .sgai/PROJECT_MANAGEMENT.md under `## STPA Findings`
2. If a GOAL checkbox is now satisfied, notify the coordinator with `GOAL COMPLETE: [exact checkbox text from GOAL.md]` instead of editing GOAL.md yourself
3. Set `status: "agent-done"` to return control

## Extra Recommendations
*CRITICAL*: Beware of letting the STPA feedback to lead to scope creep and expansion. YOUR JOB is to make the code simpler and better, and not to appease the STPA analyst. That means avoid the scope creep caused by STPA. Between fixing all hazard and keeping the code simple, prefer to make the code simple. What's a simple code? It is a piece of code that does _one_ thing, _well done_, without extra complexity - in which the failure modes can be of recognized, reasoned about, and of little consequence; and above all for this session are a trying to end up with _fewer_ lines of source code (including tests) than before.
