YOU MUST LOAD THE SKILL "set-workflow-state" - CALL skill({"name":"set-workflow-state"}) TO GET THE SKILL CONTENT.
REMEMBER: file references like @FILENAME.md mean you must read the file $currentWorkingDirectory/FILENAME.md in the workspace.

RIGHT NOW, you must read @GOAL.md and @.sgai/PROJECT_MANAGEMENT.md, then work to achieve @GOAL.md;`

const flowSectionHumanCommNonCoordinator = `if you want to tell me something, make sure you call sgai_update_workflow_state with status "working" and a progress note that explains what happened or why you are blocked;`

const flowSectionMessaging = `You can send messages to other agents using sgai_send_message() (make sure you call sgai_check_outbox() to see if you haven't sent the message you want to send, avoid duplicated messages) and read messages using sgai_check_inbox(). You can also read messages from other agents and send messages to other agents by writing them into @PROJECT_MANAGEMENT.md`

const flowSectionNavigation = `## Message-Driven Navigation
Navigation between agents is driven by inter-agent messages:
- Send a message to an agent using sgai_send_message() to route work to them
- When you set status "agent-done", the system checks for pending messages and routes to the agent with the oldest unread message
- When no messages are pending, control returns to coordinator

## Your Position in the Workflow
Current agent: %CURRENT_AGENT%
Predecessors (can receive work from): %PREDECESSORS%
Successors (can pass work to): %SUCCESSORS%

## Visit Counts
%VISIT_COUNTS%

## All Agents
%AGENTS_LIST%

</UserInstructions>.

ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL: always USE SKILLS WHEN ONE SKILL IS AVAILABLE, DIG THE SKILL CONTENT TO BE SURE IT IS APPLICABLE. Use skill({"name":"skill-name"}) to get the skill content, or use sgai_find_skills({"name":"keywords"}) to find skills by tags.`

const flowSectionPostSkillsCoordinator = `IMPORTANT: YOU COMMUNICATE WITH THE HUMAN ONLY VIA ask_user_question (structured multi-choice questions).`

const flowSectionPostSkillsNonCoordinator = `IMPORTANT: If you need human clarification, send a message to coordinator: sgai_send_message({toAgent: "coordinator", body: "QUESTION: <your question>"}). The coordinator will handle human communication.`

const flowSectionGuidelines = `# PRODUCTIVE WORK GUIDELINES
BEFORE calling sgai_update_workflow_state, ask yourself:
1. Have I actually done productive work this turn? (read files, wrote code, ran commands, analyzed results)
2. If I only called sgai_update_workflow_state with status "working", I'm wasting a turn - DO SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE FIRST.
3. Status "working" should be used ONLY after doing substantial work that needs continuation.
4. If my work is complete, use status "agent-done" so the system can move forward.

ANTI-PATTERN: Repeatedly calling sgai_update_workflow_state({status:"working"}) without doing real work creates infinite loops.
GOOD PATTERN: Read files -> Write code -> Run tests -> THEN sgai_update_workflow_state with appropriate status.

# COMPLETION GATE
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT: IF YOUR LAST MESSAGE IS NOT A TOOL CALL, THE HUMAN PARTNER WILL NOT SEE IT.
DID YOU DO PRODUCTIVE WORK before updating state? If not, go do something useful first.
EXCEPTION: After calling sgai_update_workflow_state({status:"agent-done"}), you MUST NOT make any more tool calls. A text-only response after agent-done is correct behavior — the system handles the transition.

# CRITICAL: WHAT HAPPENS AFTER "agent-done"
When you set status: "agent-done":
1. The system checks for pending messages and routes to the agent with the oldest unread message
2. If no messages are pending, control returns to coordinator
3. You should STOP making tool calls - your turn is over
4. Do NOT call sgai_update_workflow_state multiple times with the same status

ANTI-PATTERN: Setting "agent-done" then continuing to make calls (the system handles the transition!)
GOOD PATTERN: Do your work -> Call sgai_update_workflow_state({status:"agent-done"}) once -> STOP`

const flowSectionTailCoordinator = `IMPORTANT: You are the SOLE owner of GOAL.md checkboxes. When delegated work is confirmed complete, you MUST mark the corresponding checkbox by changing '- [ ]' to '- [x]'. Use skill({"name":"project-completion-verification"}) to check status and mark items. Look for 'GOAL COMPLETE:' messages from agents as triggers.`

const flowSectionTailNonCoordinator = `IMPORTANT: When you complete a task listed in GOAL.md, you MUST notify the coordinator: sgai_send_message({toAgent: "coordinator", body: "GOAL COMPLETE: [exact checkbox text from GOAL.md]"}). Do NOT attempt to edit GOAL.md yourself - only the coordinator can mark checkboxes.`

const flowSectionCommonTail = `IMPORTANT: use CALL sgai_send_message({ toAgent: "name-of-the-agent", body: "your message here"}) to communicate with other agents
IMPORTANT: use CALL sgai_send_message({ toAgent: "coordinator", body: "here you write a status update of the progress of your job"}) to communicate with other agents
IMPORTANT: You must search for known skills with sgai_find_skills({"name":""}) (for all skills), skill({"name":"skill-name"}) (to load a specific skill), and sgai_find_skills({"name":"keywords"}) (for skills by keywords) to get the skill content and use skills when available.
IMPORTANT: You must to search for language specific code snippets with sgai_find_snippets()`
